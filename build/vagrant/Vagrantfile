  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # If true, then any SSH connections made will enable agent forwarding.
  # Default value: false

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
     # Don't boot with headless mode
     #vb.gui = true
  
     # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "8"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
