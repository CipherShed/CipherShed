 TrueCrypt License Version 3.0
 .
 Software distributed under this license is distributed on an "AS
 IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS AND
 DISTRIBUTORS OF THE SOFTWARE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY. ANYONE WHO
 USES, COPIES, MODIFIES, OR (RE)DISTRIBUTES ANY PART OF THE
 SOFTWARE IS, BY SUCH ACTION(S), ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO BE
 BOUND BY ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT
 ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE, COPY, MODIFY, NOR (RE)DISTRIBUTE THE
 SOFTWARE, NOR ANY PART(S) THEREOF.
 .
 I. Definitions
 .
 1. "This Product" means the work (including, but not limited to,
 source code, graphics, texts, and accompanying files) made
 available under and governed by this version of this license
 ("License"), as may be indicated by, but is not limited to,
 copyright notice(s) attached to or included in the work.
 .
 2. "You" means (and "Your" refers to) an individual or a legal
 entity (e.g., a non-profit organization, commercial
 organization, government agency, etc.) exercising permissions
 granted by this License.
 .
 3. "Modification" means (and "modify" refers to) any alteration
 of This Product, including, but not limited to, addition to or
 deletion from the substance or structure of This Product,
 translation into another language, repackaging, alteration or
 removal of any file included with This Product, and addition of
 any new files to This Product.
 .
 4. "Your Product" means This Product modified by You, or any
 work You derive from (or base on) any part of This Product. In
 addition, "Your Product" means any work in which You include any
 (modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if
 the work in which you include it is an aggregate software
 distribution (such as an operating system distribution or a
 cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate
 products, then the term "Your Product" includes only those
 products (in the aggregate software distribution) that use,
 include, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This
 Product (and the term "Your Product" does not include the whole
 aggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this
 License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is
 considered a single product (operating system distributions and
 cover media of magazines are not considered product suites).
 .
 5. "Distribution" means (and "distribute" refers to), regardless
 of means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making
 available of This/Your Product or portions thereof to third
 parties (including, but not limited to, making This/Your
 Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third
 parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the
 product, or any portion thereof, made available for download).
 .
 .
 II. Use, Copying, and Distribution of This Product
 0. 1. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and
 conditions of this License, You may make copies of This Product
 (unmodified) and distribute copies of This Product (unmodified)
 that are not included in another product forming Your Product
 (except as permitted under Chapter III). Note: For terms and
 conditions for copying and distribution of modified versions of
 This Product, see Chapter III.
 .
 2. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and
 conditions of this License, You may use This Product freely (see
 also Chapter III) on any number of computers/systems for non-
 commercial and/or commercial purposes.
 .
 .
 III. Modification, Derivation, and Inclusion in Other Products
 .
 1. If all conditions specified in the following paragraphs in
 this Chapter (III) are met (for exceptions, see Section III.2)
 and if You comply with all other applicable terms and conditions
 of this License, You may modify This Product (thus forming Your
 Product), derive new works from This Product or portions thereof
 (thus forming Your Product), include This Product or portions
 thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product, unless
 defined otherwise in Chapter I), and You may use (for non-
 commercial and/or commercial purposes), copy, and/or distribute
 Your Product.
 .
  a. The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of
     This Product) must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for
     example, the following names are not allowed: TrueCrypt,
     TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt, etc.) nor
     any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt
     (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)
     .
     Note: TrueCrypt and the TrueCrypt logo are registered
     trademarks. The goal is not to monetize the name or the
     product, but to protect the reputation of TrueCrypt, and to
     prevent support issues and other kinds of issues that might
     arise from the existence of similar products with the same
     or similar name. Even though TrueCrypt and the TrueCrypt
     logo are trademarks, TrueCrypt is and will remain
     open-source and free software.
     .
     All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably
     be considered to identify Your Product must be removed from
     Your Product and from any associated materials. Logo(s)
     included in (or attached to) Your Product (and in/to
     associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be
     confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos
     (including, but not limited to, the non-textual logo
     consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or
     portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained  in This Product
     (logos, icons, etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or
     from Your modified version of This Product) and from any
     associated materials.
     .
  b. The following phrases must be removed from Your Product
     and from any associated materials, except the text of this
     License: "A TrueCrypt Foundation Release", "Released by
     TrueCrypt Foundation", "This is a TrueCrypt Foundation
     release."
     .
     c. Phrase "Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at
     http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be displayed by Your Product
     (if technically feasible) and contained in its
     documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion
     You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor
     portion of Your Product, phrase "Portions of this product
     are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at
     http://www.truecrypt.org/" may be displayed instead. In each
     of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph,
     "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a hyperlink (if
     technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/
     and You may freely choose the location within the user
     interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an
     "About" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will
     display the respective phrase.
     .
     Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the
     documentation, the content of the official web site of Your
     Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address
     containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name
     that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner
     that might suggest that it is where information about Your
     Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product
     may be reported or where support for Your Product may be
     available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain
     name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.
     .
  d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely
     and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2)
     at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This
     condition can be met in one or both of the following ways:
     (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product
     with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute
     and You make all such copies of Your Product available to
     the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include
     information (valid and correct at least until You cease to
     distribute Your Product) about where the complete source
     code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g.,
     an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee
     with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute
     and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your
     Product, You include the aforementioned information about
     the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web
     page to which such web site links via an easily viewable
     hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your
     Product).
     .
     The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately
     obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g.,
     the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the
     preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify
     the program.
     .
     Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in
     This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your
     Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be
     available under license(s) that (however, see also
     Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new
     works from the portions of the source code that are not
     contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute
     such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s)
     must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge,
     and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict,
     interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect
     any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The
     text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy
     of Your Product that You make and distribute.
     .
     Note: If you cannot comply with the above requirements, you
     may contact licensing@truecrypt.org.
     .
  e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in
     any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the
     license terms even if the original terms are retained),
     which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put
     under another license. You must keep intact all the legal
     notices contained in the source code files. You must include
     the following items with every copy of Your Product that You
     make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating
     that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by
     this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of
     this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein),
     a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about
     where the included copy of the License can be found, and an
     appropriate copyright notice.
    .
 2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if
 Your Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available
 only to You).
 .
 Note: If you cannot comply with Subsection III.1.d, you may
 contact licensing@truecrypt.org.
 .
 .
 IV. Disclaimer of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty,
 Indemnification
