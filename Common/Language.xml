The 'Computer Management' window should appear.\n2) In the 'Computer Management' window, select 'Storage' > 'Disk Management'.\n3) Right-click the partition you want to encrypt and select either 'Delete Partition', or 'Delete Volume', or 'Delete Logical Drive'.\n4) Click 'Yes'. If Windows asks you to restart the computer, do so. Then repeat the steps 1 and 2 and continue from the step 5.\n5) Right-click the unallocated/free space area and select either 'New Partition', or 'New Simple Volume', or 'New Logical Drive'.\n6) The 'New Partition Wizard' or 'New Simple Volume Wizard' window should appear now; follow its instructions. On the wizard page entitled 'Format Partition', select either 'Do not format this partition' or 'Do not format this volume'. In the same wizard, click 'Next' and then 'Finish'.\n7) Note that the device path you have selected in CipherShed may be wrong now. Therefore, exit the CipherShed Volume Creation Wizard (if it is still running) and then start it again.\n8) Try encrypting the device/partition again.\n\nIf CipherShed repeatedly fails to encrypt the device/partition, you may want to consider creating a file container instead.</string>

A device that contains partitions can be entirely encrypted in place (using a single master key) only if it is the drive where Windows is installed and from which it boots.\n\nIf you want to encrypt the selected non-system device using a single master key, you will need to remove all partitions on the device first to enable CipherShed to format it safely (formatting a device that contains partitions might cause system instability and/or data corruption). Alternatively, you can encrypt each partition on the drive individually (each partition will be encrypted using a different master key).\n\nNote: If you want to remove all partitions from a GPT disk, you may need to convert it to a MBR disk (using e.g. the Computer Management tool) in order to remove hidden partitions.</string>
    <string lang="en" key="WHOLE_NONSYS_DEVICE_ENC_CONFIRM">Warning: If you encrypt the entire device (as opposed to encrypting only a partition on it), operating systems will consider the device as new, empty, and unformatted (as it will contain no partition table) and may spontaneously initialize the device (or ask you if you want to do so), which may damage the volume. Furthermore, it will not be possible to consistently mount the volume as favorite (e.g. when the drive number changes) or to assign a favorite-volume label to it.\n\nTo avoid that you may want to consider creating a partition on the device and encrypting the partition instead.\n\nAre you sure want to encrypt the entire device?</string>

The volume will be mounted to a different drive letter, which you select from the list in the main CipherShed window.\n\nThe original drive letter %c: should be used only in case you need to remove encryption from the partition/device (e.g., if you no longer need encryption). In such a case, right-click the drive letter %c: in the 'Computer' (or 'My Computer') list and select 'Format'. Otherwise, the drive letter %c: should never be used (unless you remove it, as described e.g. in the CipherShed FAQ, and assign it to another partition/device).</string>

That way, you will create a CipherShed-encrypted backup of the data.\n\n3) Create a CipherShed volume on the partition that you originally wanted to encrypt and make sure that (in the CipherShed wizard) you choose the option "Create encrypted volume and format it" (instead of the option "Encrypt partition in place"). Note that all data stored on the partition will be erased. After the volume is created, mount it.\n\n4) Copy all files from the mounted backup CipherShed volume (created and mounted in step 1) to the mounted CipherShed volume that has been created (and mounted) in step 3.\n\nAfter you complete these steps, the data will be encrypted and, in addition, there will be an encrypted backup of the data.</string>

    <string lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_WRITE_PROTECTION_EXPLANATION">There are three main reasons why such countermeasures have been implemented:\n\n- It enables the creation of a secure platform for mounting of hidden CipherShed volumes. Note that we officially recommend that hidden volumes are mounted only when a hidden operating system is running. (For more information, see the subsection 'Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes' in the documentation.)\n\n- In some cases, it is possible to determine that, at a certain time, a particular filesystem was not mounted under (or that a particular file on the filesystem was not saved or accessed from within) a particular instance of an operating system (e.g. by analyzing and comparing filesystem journals, file timestamps, application logs, error logs, etc). This might indicate that a hidden operating system is installed on the computer. The countermeasures prevent these issues.\n\n- It prevents data corruption and allows safe hibernation. When Windows resumes from hibernation, it assumes that all mounted filesystems are in the same state as when the system entered hibernation. CipherShed ensures this by write-protecting any filesystem accessible both from within the decoy and hidden systems. Without such protection, the filesystem could become corrupted when mounted by one system while the other system is hibernated.</string>

CipherShed needs a device driver to provide transparent on-the-fly encryption/decryption, and users without administrator privileges cannot start device drivers in Windows. Therefore, the system will ask you for permission to run CipherShed with administrator privileges (UAC prompt).\n\nNote that if you install CipherShed on the system (as opposed to running CipherShed in portable mode), the system will NOT ask you for permission to run CipherShed (UAC prompt) every time you attempt to run it.\n\nAre you sure you want to extract the files?</string>

Then you can e.g. boot your MS Windows setup CD/DVD to repair your Windows installation.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_8">Note: Alternatively, if Windows is damaged (cannot start) and you need to repair it (or access files on it), you can avoid decrypting the system partition/drive by following these steps: If you have multiple operating systems installed on your computer, boot the one that does not require pre-boot authentication. If you do not have multiple operating systems installed on your computer, you can boot a WinPE or BartPE CD/DVD or you can connect your system drive as a secondary or external drive to another computer and then boot the operating system installed on the computer. After you boot a system, run CipherShed, click 'Select Device', select the affected system partition, click 'OK', select 'System' > 'Mount Without Pre-Boot Authentication', enter your pre-boot authentication password and click 'OK'.

    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_2">How to Create Decoy System Safely and Securely\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to achieve plausible deniability, you need to create the decoy operating system now. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_3">1) For security reasons, shut down your computer and leave it powered off for at least several minutes (the longer, the better). This is required to clear the memory, which contains sensitive data. Then turn on the computer but do not boot the hidden system.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_4">2) Install Windows on the partition whose content has been erased (i.e. on the partition where the original system, of which the hidden system is a clone, was installed).\n\nIMPORTANT: WHEN YOU START INSTALLING THE DECOY SYSTEM, THE HIDDEN SYSTEM WILL *NOT* BE POSSIBLE TO BOOT (because the CipherShed Boot Loader will be erased by the Windows system installer). THIS IS NORMAL AND EXPECTED. PLEASE DO NOT PANIC. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BOOT THE HIDDEN SYSTEM AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU START ENCRYPTING THE DECOY SYSTEM (because CipherShed will then automatically install the CipherShed Boot Loader on the system drive).\n\nImportant: The size of the decoy system partition must remain the same as the size of the hidden volume (this condition is now met). Moreover, you must not create any partition between the decoy system partition and the partition where the hidden system resides.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_5">3) Boot the decoy system (which you installed in step 2 and install CipherShed on it).\n\nKeep in mind that the decoy system must never contain any sensitive data.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_6">4) On the decoy system, run CipherShed and select 'System' &gt; 'Encrypt System Partition/Drive'. The CipherShed Volume Creation Wizard window should appear.\n\nThe following steps apply to the CipherShed Volume Creation Wizard.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_7">5) In the CipherShed Volume Creation Wizard, do NOT select the 'Hidden' option. Leave the 'Normal' option selected and click 'Next'.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_8">6) Select the option 'Encrypt the Windows system partition' and then click 'Next'.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_9">7) If there are only the hidden system and the decoy system installed on the computer, select the option 'Single-boot' (if there are more than these two systems installed on the computer, select 'Multi-boot'). Then click 'Next'.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_10">8) IMPORTANT: In this step, FOR THE DECOY SYSTEM, YOU MUST SELECT THE SAME ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM AND HASH ALGORITHM THAT YOU SELECTED FOR THE HIDDEN SYSTEM! OTHERWISE, THE HIDDEN SYSTEM WILL BE INACCESSIBLE! In other words, the decoy system must be encrypted with the same encryption algorithm as the hidden system. Note: The reason is that the decoy system and the hidden system will share a single boot loader, which supports only a single algorithm, selected by the user (for each algorithm, there is a special version of the CipherShed Boot Loader).\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_11">9) In this step, choose a password for the decoy operating system. This will be the password that you will be able to reveal to an adversary if you are asked or forced to disclose your pre-boot authentication password (the other password you can reveal is the one for the outer volume). The existence of the third password (i.e. of the pre-boot authentication password for the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\nImportant: The password you choose for the decoy system must be substantially different from the one you chose for the hidden volume (i.e. for the hidden operating system).\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_12">10) Follow the remaining instructions in the wizard so as to encrypt the decoy operating system.\n\n\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_13">After Decoy System Is Created\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter you encrypt the decoy system, the whole process of creation of the hidden operating system will be completed and you will be able to use these three passwords:\n\n1) Pre-boot authentication password for the hidden operating system.\n\n2) Pre-boot authentication password for the decoy operating system.\n\n3) Password for the outer volume.\n\n</string>

The existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_15">The third password (for the outer volume) can be disclosed to anyone forcing you to reveal the password for the first partition behind the system partition, where both the outer volume and the hidden volume (containing the hidden operating system) reside. The existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_16">If you revealed the password for the decoy system to an adversary and he asked you why the free space of the (decoy) system partition contains random data, you could answer, for example: "The partition previously contained a system encrypted by CipherShed, but I forgot the pre-boot authentication password (or the system was damaged and stopped booting), so I had to reinstall Windows and encrypt the partition again."\n\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_17">If all the instructions are followed and if the precautions and requirements listed in the section "Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes" in the CipherShed User's Guide are followed, it should be impossible to prove that the hidden volume and hidden operating system exist, even when the outer volume is mounted or when the decoy operating system is decrypted or started.\n\nIf you save a copy of this text or print it (strongly recommended, unless your printer stores copies of documents it prints on its internal drive), you should destroy any copies of it after you have created the decoy system and after you have understood all the information contained in the text (otherwise, if such a copy was found, it might indicate that there is a hidden operating system on this computer).\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_18">WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT PROTECT THE HIDDEN VOLUME (for information on how to do so, refer to the section "Protection of Hidden Volumes Against Damage" in the CipherShed User's Guide), DO NOT WRITE TO THE OUTER VOLUME (note that the decoy operating system is NOT installed in the outer volume).

This is not caused by a bug in CipherShed. A possible solution is to move your container to, e.g., your 'Documents' folder.\n\nIf you intend to keep your volume read-only, set the read-only attribute of the container (right-click the container and select Properties > Read-only), which will suppress this warning.</string>
