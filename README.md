CipherShed is cross-platform on-the-fly encryption software.

For more information, please see our website at [https://ciphershed.org](https://ciphershed.org).

The source tarball, `TrueCrypt 7.1a Source.tar.gz`, has been verified to be original using cryptographic hashes. The extracted files have been verified as well (`README.md` file added, but nothing else changed). The checksums are included with the tarball in the initial commit.

Please verify and scrutinize everything we do!
