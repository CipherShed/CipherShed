# CipherShed
CipherShed is on-the-fly encryption software based off of the discontinued [TrueCrypt][TC] project.

URLs: [http://ciphershed.org][MAIN] and our [GitHub][GH]

For info on compiling the sources under Linux, see here: [http://truecrypt.ch:2080/t/linux-build-from-source/46]

## Project Goals
* Audit and defend the security of the existing TrueCrypt 7.1a code base.
* Improve security using modern techniques such as memory-hard password hashing.
* Secure the code through audits, simplification, and a secure architecture.
* Migrate towards a truly FOSS code base.
* Work closely with existing efforts such as [OpenCryptoAuditProject][OCAP], [LUKS][LUKS], [GELI][GELI], and [tc-play][TCP].
